# turbo-scout

### Naming
A random name generator was used for the temporary project name `turbo-scout`.

### Bulleted list of future plans
* Having a server
* Sending text data to that server 
    * Pit scouting
    * Match scouting
        * Position-based to begin with
        * More options if they are required
* Image uploading
    * Different fields for photos of the bot, photos of their pit and photos of their auto routines.
* A system of 'configurations' like swerve-scout has for different seasons.
* PWA
* Data viewer or exporter
    * This will require a lot of thought
    * Might be nice to stick with a sharable PDF file that can be posted in discord- although that limits our options for display.
    * Use TBA and/or statbotics data alongside our own
    * Also, aggregate data from previous regionals.
* Getting team info from TBA
* Support for a pit map within the app
    * Some vision system that highlights the pit location of a team you want to look at
    * Pathfinding, if we have a lot of extra time or people
